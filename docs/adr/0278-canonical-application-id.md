## Context

The product advertised `com.pi-desktop.app` as the application ID, an identity
inherited from before the product was its own. Default unsigned macOS packs
also left Electron's adhoc signature on `QianNing Agent.app`
(`Identifier=Electron`, `Info.plist=not bound`). `usernotificationsd` then
required the private
`com.apple.private.usernotifications.bundle-identifiers` entitlement and
refused every request for the product bundle ID (issue #524). Adhoc signing
itself is not the defect: the identifier must equal `CFBundleIdentifier`.

## Decision

1. The canonical application ID is **`com.qianning.agent`**. It is `APP_ID`,
   electron-builder `appId`, macOS `CFBundleIdentifier`, the unsigned-helper
   expected bundle ID, and the Windows AppUserModelID. Development macOS hosts
   use `com.qianning.agent.dev`.
2. NSIS/AppUserModelID follow the same ID. Installs carrying an earlier
   identifier are a new identity after this cut.
3. Unsigned GitHub macOS packs do **not** re-sign the outer bundle. An
   `afterPack` adhoc `codesign` fails because nested Electron helpers are
   still unsigned (`code object is not signed at all`). Issue #524 remains
   open on the default unsigned lane until a later signed or helper-safe
   pack path.

## Consequences

- Packaged unsigned macOS artifacts keep Electron's outer identifier.
- Signed/notarized builds use Developer ID with the product bundle ID.
- Windows upgrades from an install carrying an earlier identifier are a new
  product identity; users may see a parallel shortcut until the old install
  is removed.

## Alternatives considered

- Keep `com.pi-desktop.app` and only re-sign: rejected because the identity
  must belong to the product rather than to a predecessor.
- Change only the macOS bundle ID: rejected because D141 requires one ID
  across runtime and packaging.
- Adhoc-sign in `afterPack`/`afterSign`: rejected; nested helpers are not
  signed yet and the pack fails.
